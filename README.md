# SudokuSolver

This project pulls a random Sudoku puzzle from a dataset of a million puzzles and solves it. 

The specific dataset I used is called "1 million Sudoku Puzzles", and I downloaded it off of Kaggle.
I was unable to upload the file to Github becasue of its size, but this is the link to the site:
https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku

For a future version I would consider looking into the Backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles.
