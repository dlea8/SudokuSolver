# SudokuSolver

This project pulls a random Sudoku puzzle from a dataset of a million puzzles and solves it. 

The specific dataset I used is called "1 million Sudoku Puzzles", and I downloaded it off of Kaggle.

For a future version I would consider looking into the Backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles.
